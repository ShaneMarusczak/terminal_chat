Terminal Chat is an interactive, terminal‚Äêbased chat application built with Rust. It allows you to have real-time conversations with OpenAI's API while leveraging various commands to manage and document sessions. The project is designed to be highly efficient, minimal, and provides a responsive command-line interface with an integrated spinner and auto-completion support.

- Command parser for extended functionality
- Integrated spinner for visual feedback during long-running API calls
- File-based context augmentation (upload file contents to chat context)
- Automated documentation and report generation in Markdown
- Modular design for easy future expansion

## Usage Guide

- **Chatting:**
  Simply type your message at the prompt (üó£Ô∏è). The application will send your input to the OpenAI API and stream the response in real-time.

- **Commands:**
  Commands are prefixed with a colon (`:`). Some common commands include:

  - `:help` ‚Äì Display this help and available commands
  - `:clear` ‚Äì Clears the current conversation context
  - `:cm` ‚Äì Change the active Chat model
  - `:gf <file1> <file2> ...` ‚Äì Add the contents of specified files to the conversation context
  - `:readme <directory> [extensions...]` ‚Äì Generate a README.md document based on files in a directory
  - `:doc` ‚Äì Document the current context into a Markdown report
  - `:q` or `:quit` ‚Äì Quit the application

- **Tips:**

  - If a command is unrecognized, the tool will suggest a similar command based on minimum edit distance.
  - For commands that generate output files (such as readme and doc), follow the prompts to confirm the filename and save location.
