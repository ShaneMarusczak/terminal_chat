# Terminal Chat (tc)

[![Rust CI](https://github.com/ShaneMarusczak/terminal_chat/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/ShaneMarusczak/terminal_chat/actions/workflows/rust.yml)

Terminal Chat is a command line chat interface built in Rust. It allows interactive, conversational sessions with OpenAI‚Äôs language models. Users can chat in real time with streaming responses or perform various commands (e.g., clearing conversations, debugging, document and README generation, and more). The project emphasizes concise, accurate communication and provides a friendly environment for both casual and development-related conversations.

## File and Structure Overview

‚Ä¢ **src/main.rs**  
   - Contains the main entry point and command loop.  
   - Sets up the interactive CLI using the [linefeed](https://docs.rs/linefeed/) crate.

‚Ä¢ **src/chat_client.rs**  
   - Responsible for making HTTP requests to OpenAI API endpoints.  
   - Implements both streaming and traditional request/response chat functions.

‚Ä¢ **src/conversation.rs**  
   - Defines conversation context, message structure, and response data types.  
   - Manages message history and conversation state.

‚Ä¢ **src/commands.rs**  
   - Implements support for chat and development commands (clear, debug, doc, change model, readme generation, etc.).  
   - Handles file operations and document/report generation.

‚Ä¢ **src/spinner.rs**  
   - Provides a spinner animation while asynchronous operations (e.g., network requests) are in progress.

‚Ä¢ **src/messages.rs**  
   - Contains default messages and prompts that guide conversation and report generation.
