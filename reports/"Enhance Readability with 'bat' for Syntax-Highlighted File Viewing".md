"Enhance Readability with 'bat' for Syntax-Highlighted File Viewing"

Hereâ€™s what using `bat` looks like:

```bash
bat path/to/your/file.md
```

When you run this command, `bat` displays your Markdown file with syntax highlighting and line numbers, making it much more readable compared to a plain `cat` output. This is particularly useful for previewing Markdown files quickly without conversion to HTML or opening a dedicated text editor. If you don't have `bat` installed, you can find installation instructions for various platforms on [bat's GitHub page](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat).
